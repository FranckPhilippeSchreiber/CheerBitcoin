# CheerBitcoin
Building a happiness economy

CheerBitcoin is a token that aims to create a decentralized economy of happiness.
It is designed to promote the well-being and fulfillment of individuals within a preserved planet: CheerBitcoin allows donations, encourages positive behaviors, the practice of gratitude, mutual aid and actions beneficial to humanity. 
 
Based on the Polygon zkEVM blockchain that is fully compatible with Ethereum, the token developed in the Solidity language, once listed on exchange platforms, will allow donations to charities to be made in a transparent and secure way. 
CheerBitcoin implements, thanks to the Blockchain and the votes of the token's holders, a system of rewards for positive actions, thus promoting commitment to the common good. 
With a community-centric token distribution and its blockchain-secured voting system, CheerBitcoin is focused on organic, participatory, and democratic growth. 

CheerBitcoin aims to be accessible to everyone.

Governance

The steering committee (5 seats) proposes future developments of CheerBitcoin's features in line with the project's value proposition. It offers a list of charitable organizations intended for donations.
The user community votes to confirm:
-	decisions on future developments, 
-	donations proposed by the Board of Directors to charities,
-	Rewards for positive actions.

Key functions of CheerBitcoin :
1.	Transparent donations to charities: thanks to a dedicated reserve, topped up from the creation of the CheerBitcoin and then replenished by 0.1% of the amount of transactions, the CheerBitcoin token is used for donation campaigns to charities in a transparent and secure way, using blockchain technology. CheerBitcoin holders vote for the charity that will receive a donation.
2.	Reward for community participation: A significant portion of the token supply is reserved for the community, which promotes organic growth and user participation.
3.	Stimulating positive behaviors: CheerBitcoin rewards, via a voting system, users for positive actions and beneficial contributions to the common good, which encourages positive behavior and active participation.
4.	Accessibility: CheerBitcoin is a useful token with a clear value proposition that aims to be easily accessible to everyone via decentralized and centralized exchanges.
5.	Inclusivity: CheerBitcoin fosters an economy that values the happiness and well-being of all its participants. Exchanging CheerBitcoin provides the assurance of doing good indirectly via the donation mechanism. Holding CheerBitcoin gives the right to vote for the best contributions to the community. The maximum number of CheerBitcoin tokens is set at inception and CheerBitcoin's unique value proposition paves the way for mass adoption for a significant increase in the token's value following its adoption.
6.	The Blacklisting of an address allows CheerBitcoin assets to be frozen in the event of proof of money laundering or terrorist financing in accordance with Article L. 562-4 of the french Monetary and Financial Code.
7.	Limiting the maximum amount of transactions on DEXs is the most pragmatic method found to fight money laundering in accordance with Article L. 561-2 of the french Monetary and Financial Code.

Together, these features make CheerBitcoin more than just a token: it's a tool to foster positivity, community engagement, and a happiness-centric economy in compliance with French crypto asset regulations.

Project development phases

The first phase is materialized by the programming of the first version of the CheerBitcoin (C) smart contract, its registration on the chosen blockchain (Polygon zkEVM), the creation of the website (www.CheerBitcoin.org), social networks and the listing on a decentralized exchange(s) (DEX).
The initial costs, according to a frugal and controlled development plan, will be covered by the contributions of the founders or relatives: contributions in industry or contributions in cryptocurrencies, in particular for the liquidity pools required for listing on DEXs.

The subsequent phases consist of:
- the expansion of the community, 
- the programming of the smart contract's evolutions by adding all the functionalities provided for in the project roadmap,
- Listing on centralized exchanges (CEXs).
These subsequent phases will be financed by the success of the first phase. It is the valuation of the token on the exchange platforms that will allow a gradual and measured sale, the objective being to cover the financing needs to increase the utility and thus the creation of value of the token for the entire Community.
